What is a credit score?
Financial matters can be complicated, but understanding your credit score doesn't have to be. If you have any credit accounts, such as credit cards or loans, you have a credit report. Your credit report is a record of how you manage your money. This data is then distilled and calculated to create your credit score. While lenders use these reports and credit scores to decide whether or not to extend you credit, it leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

## How is my credit score calculated?
To see how it all breaks down, here's an example of how most scores are calculated. Your payment history generally makes up 40% of your score, while credit utilization is 20%. The length of your credit history contributes 21%, and total amount of recently reported balances 11%. Finally, new credit accounts are responsible for 5% while your available credit makes up 3%. All of these values are then broken down into a credit score, which typically ranges between 300 and 850—the higher the number the better. TransUnion's credit score check can let you know where your score falls.

## What affects credit scores the most?
Your payment history is the most important aspect of your credit score, because it shows how you’ve managed your finances, including any late payments. Your credit history is also very important, as it demonstrates how long you've been managing your accounts, when your last payments were made, and any recent charges.
